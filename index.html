    <blockquote>The gospel of Jesus Christ is filled with His power, which is available to every earnestly seeking daughter or son of God. It is my testimony that when we draw His power into our lives, both He and we will rejoice.

    <p>I believe a faith in Jesus Christ can benefit anyone who will put in 
        the time for it. I highly recommend one reading the Bible and The 
        Book of Mormon in their search to find peace in Christ.</p>

    <h2">Research and IT</h2>
    <p>I have a strong interest in improving the way that we do research online. 
        These are among the common online research engines I have analyzed to 
        improve algorithms and methods of conducting accurate online research.</p>
    
    <p>Asside from my research, I enjoy making doing service, enjoying time 
        with my family, and writing music. Here is a portion of a composition
         I wrote.</p>
    <p>I love talking with individuals about my experiences, and discussing 
        with intestested persons about theirs. Please feel free to 
        <a" href="html/contact.html">contact</a> me.</p>
